First off, thank you for considering contributing to HAL. It's people like you that make HAL such a great tool. HAL is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into HAL itself.

Getting involved is easier than you think. All resources that you need are available on the internet.

# Build it

The first step to get started is to build HAL yourself. This requires creating a GitHub account, forking HAL, and cloning your private fork. The [build & run]({{< relref "/development/build-run.md" >}}) page contains complete instructions for this.
